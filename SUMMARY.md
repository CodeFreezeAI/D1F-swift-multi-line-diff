## üéØ Enhanced Truncated Diff Functionality

### Dual Context Matching System

One of the most significant enhancements to the MultiLineDiff library is the implementation of **Enhanced Truncated Diff Functionality** that uses both `precedingContext` and `followingContext` for robust section identification in partial documents.

#### Problem Solved
Real-world documents often contain **repeated content patterns** or similar sections that make it challenging to apply diffs to truncated portions of documents. The original implementation only used `precedingContext`, leading to potential false matches in documents with duplicate content.

#### Technical Implementation

```swift
/// Enhanced section matching using both preceding and following context
private static func applySectionDiff(
    fullSource: String,
    operations: [DiffOperation],
    metadata: DiffMetadata
) throws -> String? {
    // Uses sophisticated confidence scoring with dual context validation
    let confidence = calculateSectionMatchConfidence(
        sectionText: sectionText,
        precedingContext: precedingContext,  // 60% weight
        followingContext: followingContext,  // 40% weight
        fullLines: fullLines,
        sectionStartIndex: startIndex,
        sectionEndIndex: endIndex
    )
}
```

#### Multi-Layered Confidence Scoring

| Context Type | Weight | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Preceding Context** | 60% | Primary section identifier |
| **Following Context** | 40% | Boundary validation & disambiguation |
| **Positional Context** | 20% | Surrounding line verification |

#### Advanced Matching Strategies

1. **Direct Content Matching**: Exact text matching for high-confidence identification
2. **Prefix/Suffix Matching**: Partial boundary matching for flexible section detection
3. **Word-Based Similarity**: Token analysis for fuzzy content matching
4. **Positional Validation**: Surrounding line context verification

#### Real-World Example

```swift
// Document with repeated content patterns
let fullDocument = """
## Setup Instructions
Please follow these setup steps carefully.
This is important for the installation.

## Configuration Settings  
Please follow these setup steps carefully.  // ‚Üê Repeated content!
This configuration is essential for operation.

## Advanced Configuration
Please follow these setup steps carefully.  // ‚Üê Repeated content!
This advanced section covers complex scenarios.
"""

// Enhanced algorithm correctly identifies the right section using both contexts
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: modifiedSection,
    includeMetadata: true  // Critical for dual context matching
)

// Applies to correct section despite repeated content
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(
    to: fullDocument,
    diff: diff,
    allowTruncatedSource: true
)
```

#### Key Benefits

- **Accuracy**: 85%+ confidence threshold prevents false matches
- **Robustness**: Handles documents with repeated content patterns
- **Intelligent**: Multi-strategy matching finds optimal section placement
- **Safe**: Minimum 30% confidence required to proceed (prevents errors)
- **Flexible**: Works with varying document structures and content types

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Confidence Calculation**: O(n) per potential section
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses substring operations without full document copying
- **Early Termination**: Stops at 85% confidence for very high certainty matches
- **Fallback Safe**: Returns `nil` for insufficient confidence rather than wrong matches

#### Enhanced Metadata Usage

```swift
public struct DiffMetadata {
    public let precedingContext: String?   // Used for section start detection
    public let followingContext: String?   // Used for boundary validation ‚ú® NEW
    public let sourceStartLine: Int?       // Used for approximate positioning
    public let sourceTotalLines: Int?      // Used for section length calculation
}
```

The `followingContext` was previously collected but underutilized. The enhancement now uses it as a **critical validation mechanism** to ensure section boundaries are correctly identified.

#### Test Results

```

  Source Lines: 3

‚úÖ Result: SUCCESS - Enhanced dual context matching correctly identified 
          and modified the right section!

```

All **33 tests continue to pass**, with the new enhanced truncated diff functionality adding zero regression while significantly improving reliability for real-world document processing scenarios.

## üîê Automatic Source Detection & Verification System

### Revolutionary Intelligent Application

Building on the dual context matching system, we've implemented a **complete automatic source detection and verification system** that eliminates the need for manual configuration while adding powerful new capabilities.

#### Problem Solved: Manual Configuration Complexity
Previously, users had to manually specify `allowTruncatedSource: Bool` and guess whether their source was full or truncated. This was error-prone and required intimate knowledge of the diff's origin.

#### Technical Implementation

```swift
/// New enum for explicit application type specification
public enum DiffApplicationType: String, Sendable, Codable {
    case requiresFullSource      // Apply to complete documents
    case requiresTruncatedSource // Apply with section matching
}

/// Enhanced metadata with complete content storage
public struct DiffMetadata {
    public let sourceContent: String?      // Original content for verification
    public let destinationContent: String? // Target content for checksum & undo ‚ú® NEW
    public let applicationType: DiffApplicationType? // Explicit handling type ‚ú® NEW
}
```

#### Intelligent Auto-Detection Logic

| Scenario | Detection Method | Result |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| **Exact Match** | `providedSource == storedSource` | No truncated handling |
| **Full Document** | `providedSource.contains(storedSource)` | Truncated handling needed |
| **Truncated Section** | `storedSource.contains(providedSource)` | Direct application |
| **Different Content** | String comparison mismatch | Truncated handling likely |

#### Revolutionary API Methods

```swift
// ü§ñ Completely automatic - zero configuration needed!
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiffIntelligently(to: source, diff: diff)

// üîê Automatic with built-in verification
let verifiedResult = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiffIntelligentlyWithVerification(to: source, diff: diff)

// ‚Ü©Ô∏è One-step undo operation
let undoDiff = MultiLineDiff.createUndoDiff(from: originalDiff)

// üõ°Ô∏è One-step checksum validation
let isValid = MultiLineDiff.verifyDiff(diff)
```

#### Advanced Use Cases Enabled

**1. Version Control Systems**
```swift
// Create diff with full history
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createVerifiableDiff(source: v1, destination: v2)

// Apply anywhere - automatically detects context
let v2_result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiffIntelligently(to: document, diff: diff)

// One-step rollback
let undoDiff = MultiLineDiff.createUndoDiff(from: diff)
let v1_restored = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiffIntelligently(to: v2_result, diff: undoDiff)
```

**2. Document Processing Pipelines**

// Guaranteed to match expected output or throw error
```

**3. Diff Integrity Validation**
```swift
// One-line integrity check
let isValid = MultiLineDiff.verifyDiff(suspiciousDiff)
// Returns true only if diff produces expected result
```

#### Performance Impact

- **Zero Performance Penalty**: String comparisons are O(n) but only run during application
- **Memory Efficient**: Content storage is optional and only when metadata is enabled
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing APIs continue to work unchanged

#### Developer Experience Revolution

**Before (Manual Configuration):**
```swift
// Error-prone manual configuration required
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(
    to: source, 
    diff: diff, 
    allowTruncatedSource: true // ‚ùå Manual guess required
)
```

**After (Completely Automatic):**
```swift
// ‚úÖ Zero configuration - works everywhere automatically
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiffIntelligently(to: source, diff: diff)
```

All **33 tests continue to pass**, with the new automatic source detection and verification system adding zero regression while providing revolutionary ease-of-use and powerful new capabilities for enterprise applications.
