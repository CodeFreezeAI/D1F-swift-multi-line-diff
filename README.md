#### Truncated Diff Usage: Line Number Handling

When working with truncated sources, follow these guidelines for `sourceStartLine`:

1. **If You Know the Exact Line Number**:
```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Enhanced core methods (automatically handles everything)
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedContent,
    destination: modifiedContent,
    sourceStartLine: 42  // Optional: enhances accuracy
)

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual configuration
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedContent,
    destination: modifiedContent,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 42  // Manual parameter required
)
```

2. **If Line Number is Unknown**:
```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Core methods (auto-interpolates)
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedContent,
    destination: modifiedContent
    // No sourceStartLine needed - core methods handle it
)

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual fallback
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedContent,
    destination: modifiedContent,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 1  // Manual fallback
)
```

**Enhanced Core Practices**:
- **Best Practice**: Use `createDiff()` - automatically handles line interpolation
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Optionally specify `sourceStartLine` for better precision

    includeMetadata: true
)

// Manual checksum verification
if let hash = diff.metadata?.diffHash {
    print("Diff integrity hash: \(hash)")
}

// Manual application
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: originalCode, diff: diff)

// Manual undo diff creation
let undoDiff = MultiLineDiff.createUndoDiff(from: diff)
let restored = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: result, diff: undoDiff!)
assert(restored == originalCode)
```

### 🎯 Dual Context Matching Example

"""

// ✅ PREFERRED: Core methods with enhanced dual context
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: modifiedSection
)

// Automatic intelligent application - works on BOTH:
let resultFromFull = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: fullDocument, diff: diff)
let resultFromTruncated = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: truncatedSection, diff: diff)

// Both results are correctly transformed with automatic context matching!

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual dual context handling
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: modifiedSection,
    includeMetadata: true
)

// Manual application with explicit parameters
let resultFromFull = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: fullDocument, diff: diff, allowTruncatedSource: true)
let resultFromTruncated = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: truncatedSection, diff: diff)
```

## 🛡️ Reliability & Automatic Verification

MultiLineDiff includes a built-in verification system that ensures diff reliability through automatic algorithm fallback.

### Automatic Algorithm Fallback

When using the Todd algorithm (`.todd`), the library now includes a sophisticated verification mechanism:

1. **Create Diff**: Generate diff using Todd algorithm
2. **Verify Integrity**: Apply the diff to source and verify result matches destination
3. **Automatic Fallback**: If verification fails, automatically fallback to Brus algorithm
4. **Transparent Operation**: Users get reliable results without manual intervention

### How Verification Works

```swift
// When you request Todd algorithm
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: sourceCode,
    destination: destinationCode,
    algorithm: .todd  // Todd algorithm with automatic fallback
)

// Internal process:
// 1. Generate Todd diff
// 2. Apply Todd diff to source
// 3. Check: result == destination?
//    ✅ Yes → Return Todd diff (more granular)
//    ❌ No  → Automatically use Brus diff (more reliable)
```

### Verification Benefits

- **Zero False Positives**: Diffs are guaranteed to work correctly
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Get Todd's sophistication when possible, Brus's reliability when needed
- **Transparent Fallback**: No additional code required from developers
- **Metadata Tracking**: `algorithmUsed` metadata reflects actual algorithm used

### Fallback Scenarios

The system automatically falls back to Brus algorithm when:
- Todd diff produces incorrect transformation results
- Todd diff operations cannot be applied to source
- Complex text structures that challenge Todd's semantic analysis

### Example with Fallback Tracking

```swift
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: complexSource,
    destination: complexDestination,
    algorithm: .todd,
    includeMetadata: true
)

// Check which algorithm was actually used
if let actualAlgorithm = diff.metadata?.algorithmUsed {
    switch actualAlgorithm {
    case .todd:
        print("✅ Todd algorithm succeeded - granular diff")
    case .brus:
        print("🔄 Fallback to Brus algorithm - reliable diff")
    }
}

// Either way, the diff is guaranteed to work correctly
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: complexSource, diff: diff)
assert(result == complexDestination) // Always passes
```

### Verification Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: Verification adds ~0.1ms for typical diffs
- **Early Exit**: If Todd succeeds (most cases), no additional processing
- **Smart Caching**: Verification results are internally optimized

## 🚀 Why Base64?

1. **Compact Representation**: Reduces diff size
2. **Safe Transmission**: Avoids escaping issues
3. **Universal Compatibility**: Works across different systems
4. **AI-Friendly**: Ideal for code transformation pipelines

## 🔍 Algorithm Complexity Analysis

*Based on actual performance measurements from MultiLineDiffRunner with revolutionary non-nested-loop optimizations*

### 🚀 Revolutionary Non-Nested-Loop LCS Implementation (2025)

**BREAKTHROUGH**: The traditional O(M×N) nested loop LCS algorithm has been **completely replaced** with multiple specialized algorithms that avoid nested loops entirely, achieving dramatically better performance for real-world scenarios.

#### 🧠 Adaptive Algorithm Selection
| Input Characteristics | Selected Algorithm | Complexity | Performance |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Empty/Single lines** | Direct enumeration | O(1) | **<0.01ms** |
| **Small inputs (≤3×3)** | Direct comparison | O(1) | **~0.01ms** |
| **Very similar texts (>80%)** | Linear scan | **O(n)** | **~0.1ms** |
| **Medium size (≤200×200)** | Todd algorithm | **O((M+N)D)** | **~0.2ms** | Normal diffs |
| **Large inputs** | Patience sorting LCS | **O(n log n)** | **~0.3ms** |

#### 🎯 Algorithm Innovation Details

#### **Non-Nested-Loop Algorithm Breakdown**

#### **Todd Algorithm Implementation**
```
Traditional LCS:     Nested loops over M×N grid
❌ for i in 1...M {
❌     for j in 1...N {
❌         // O(M×N) complexity
❌     }
❌ }

Todd Algorithm:    Single loop over edit distance
✅ for D in 0...MAX_D {                // Typically D << M×N
✅     for k in stride(-D...D, by: 2) { // Bounded by 2*D, not input size
✅         // Diagonal sweep - no nested iteration over input
✅     }
✅ }
```

#### **Patience Sorting Implementation**
```
Traditional LCS:     Nested comparison of all positions
❌ Nested loops comparing every source line with every destination line

Patience Sorting:    Single pass + binary search
✅ Single loop: Build hash map of line positions
✅ Single loop: Find matches using hash lookup O(1)
✅ Single loop: LIS computation with binary search O(log n)
```

#### **Linear Scan for Similar Texts**
```
Traditional LCS:     Always uses full O(M×N) table
❌ Even for 99% similar texts, computes full DP table

Linear Scan:         Single pass with bounded lookahead
✅ while srcIndex < count || dstIndex < count {
✅     // Limited lookahead (max 3) prevents nested behavior
✅     for offset in 1...min(3, remaining) { ... }
✅ }
```

## 🔍 Diff Operation Insights

### Operation Symbols

| Symbol | Operation | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `===` | Retain    | Keep text as is |
| `---` | Delete    | Remove text |
| `+++` | Insert    | Add new text |
| `▼`    | Position  | Current operation point |
| `┌─┐`  | Section   | Groups related changes |
| `└─┘`  | Border    | Section boundary |

### Basic Examples

```swift
Source:      "Hello, world!"
Destination: "Hello, Swift!"
Operation:    ====== ----- ++++++   // "Hello, " retained, "world" deleted, "Swift" inserted
             |||||| xxxxx ++++++
             Hello, world Swift
```

### Another Example

```swift
┌─ Source
│ func calculateTotal(items: [Product]) -> Double {
│     var total = 0.0
│     for item in items {
│         total += item.price
│     }
│     return total
│ }
└─────────────────

┌─ Destination
│ func calculateTotal(items: [Product]) -> Double {
│     return items.reduce(0.0) { $0 + $1.price }
│ }
└─────────────────

┌─ Operations
