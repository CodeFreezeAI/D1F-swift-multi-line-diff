## ⚡ Flash Algorithm (.flash)

### 🎯 What is Flash?

Flash is the **fastest** diff algorithm in the MultiLineDiff library, using Swift's native string manipulation methods (`commonPrefix`, `commonSuffix`) for lightning-fast performance.

### 🔧 How Flash Works

```swift
// Flash Algorithm Process:
// 1. Find common prefix between source and destination
// 2. Find common suffix in remaining text
// 3. Generate minimal operations for the middle section

let source = "Hello, world!"
let destination = "Hello, Swift!"

// Flash identifies:
// Prefix: "Hello, " (7 chars) → RETAIN
// Middle: "world" → DELETE, "Swift" → INSERT  
// Suffix: "!" (1 char) → RETAIN
```

### 📊 Flash Operation Types

Flash generates three core operation types:

```swift
@frozen public enum DiffOperation {
    case retain(Int)      // 📎 Keep characters from source
    case insert(String)   // ✅ Add new content
    case delete(Int)      // ❌ Remove characters from source
}
```

### 🚀 Using Flash Algorithm

#### Basic Usage

```swift
// Create diff using Flash algorithm
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: "Hello, world!",
    destination: "Hello, Swift!",
    algorithm: .flash
)

// Apply the diff
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: source, diff: diff)
print(result) // "Hello, Swift!"
```

#### Display Flash Diffs

```swift
// Generate AI-friendly ASCII diff
let aiDiff = MultiLineDiff.createAndDisplayDiff(
    source: oldCode,
    destination: newCode,
    format: .ai,
    algorithm: .flash
)

// Generate terminal diff with colors
let terminalDiff = MultiLineDiff.createAndDisplayDiff(
    source: oldCode,
    destination: newCode,
    format: .terminal,
    algorithm: .flash
)
```

### 📝 Flash Example: Function Signature Change

**Source Code:**
```swift
func greet(name: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}
```

**Destination Code:**
```swift
func greet(name: String, greeting: String = "Hello") -> String {
    return "\(greeting), \(name)!"
}
```

**Flash ASCII Diff Output:**
```swift
📎 func greet(name: String
❌ ) -> String {
❌     return "Hello
✅ , greeting: String = "Hello") -> String {
✅     return "\(greeting)
📎 , \(name)!"
📎 }
```

**Flash Operations:**
```swift
[
    .retain(22),  // "func greet(name: String"
    .delete(25),  // ") -> String {\n    return \"Hello"
    .insert(", greeting: String = \"Hello\") -> String {\n    return \"\(greeting)"),
    .retain(10)   // ", \(name)!\"\n}"
]
```

### ⚡ Flash Advantages

| 🎯 Advantage | 📊 Benefit |
|-------------|-----------|
| **🚀 Speed** | 2.3x faster than nearest competitor |
| **🔧 Simplicity** | Minimal operations (typically 3-4) |
| **🧠 Memory** | Low memory footprint |

| **📊 Operations** | Fewer operations may miss fine details |

## 🤖 Optimus Algorithm (.optimus)

### 🎯 What is Optimus?

Optimus combines the **power of CollectionDifference** with **line-aware processing**, providing Todd-compatible operation counts with enhanced performance.

### 🔧 How Optimus Works

```swift
// Optimus Algorithm Process:
// 1. Split text into lines preserving line endings
// 2. Use CollectionDifference to find line changes
// 3. Convert to character-based operations
// 4. Consolidate consecutive operations

let sourceLines = source.efficientLines
let destLines = destination.efficientLines
let difference = destLines.difference(from: sourceLines)
```

### 🚀 Using Optimus Algorithm

#### Basic Usage

```swift
// Create diff using Optimus algorithm
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: sourceCode,
    destination: modifiedCode,
    algorithm: .optimus
)

// Apply the diff
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: sourceCode, diff: diff)
```

#### Advanced Usage with Metadata

```swift
// Create diff with metadata for debugging
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: sourceCode,
    destination: modifiedCode,
    algorithm: .optimus,
    includeMetadata: true
)

print("Algorithm used: \(diff.metadata?.algorithmUsed?.displayName ?? "Unknown")")
print("Operations count: \(diff.operations.count)")
```

### 📝 Optimus Example: Class Enhancement

**Source Code:**
```swift
class UserManager {
    private var users: [String: User] = [:]
    
    func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
        guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
            return false
        }
        
        let user = User(name: name, email: email)
        users[email] = user
        return true
    }
}
```

**Destination Code:**
```swift
class UserManager {
    private var users: [String: User] = [:]
    private var userCount: Int = 0
    
    func addUser(name: String, email: String, age: Int = 0) -> Result<User, UserError> {
        guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
            return .failure(.invalidInput)
        }
        
        let user = User(id: UUID(), name: name, email: email, age: age)
        users[email] = user
        userCount += 1
        return .success(user)
    }
}
```

**Optimus ASCII Diff Output:**
```swift
📎 class UserManager {
📎     private var users: [String: User] = [:]
✅     private var userCount: Int = 0
📎     
❌     func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
✅     func addUser(name: String, email: String, age: Int = 0) -> Result<User, UserError> {
📎         guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
❌             return false
✅             return .failure(.invalidInput)
📎         }
📎         
❌         let user = User(name: name, email: email)
✅         let user = User(id: UUID(), name: name, email: email, age: age)
📎         users[email] = user
❌         return true
✅         userCount += 1
✅         return .success(user)
📎     }
📎 }
```

// Delete: "world" (5 characters)

.delete(5)  // Remove "world"
```

### ✅ Insert Operations

**Purpose**: Add new content not present in the source.

```swift
// Source: "Hello, world!"
// Destination: "Hello, Swift!"
// Insert: "Swift" (new content)

.insert("Swift")  // Add "Swift"
```

### 🔄 Complete Operation Sequence

```swift
// Transform "Hello, world!" → "Hello, Swift!"
let operations: [DiffOperation] = [
    .retain(7),      // Keep "Hello, "
    .delete(5),      // Remove "world"
    .insert("Swift"), // Add "Swift"
    .retain(1)       // Keep "!"
]
```

# MultiLineDiff: ASCII Diff I/O and Terminal Output Documentation

## 🔤 ASCII Diff Symbols and Formatting

### Symbol Rules

**IMPORTANT:** All diff symbols are EXACTLY two characters:
- `📎 ` (Paperclip + space): Retained/unchanged lines
- `❌ ` (Red X + space): Lines to be removed
- `✅ ` (Green checkmark + space): Lines to be added

### Color Coding and Visual Meaning

| Symbol | Operation | Visual Meaning | Description |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| `📎 `  | Retain    | 📎 Paperclip | Unchanged lines - "keeps code together" |
| `❌ `  | Delete    | ❌ Red X | Lines to be removed - "delete this" |
| `✅ `  | Insert    | ✅ Green checkmark | New lines to be added - "add this" |
| `❓ `  | Unknown   | ❓ Question mark | Unknown operations - "unclear" |

## 🌈 Terminal Diff Output

### How Terminal Users See Diffs

When using `.terminal` format, users see colorful emoji symbols that make diffs instantly readable:

```swift
📎 class UserManager {
📎     private var users: [String: User] = [:]
✅     private var userCount: Int = 0
📎     
❌     func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
✅     func addUser(name: String, email: String, age: Int = 0) -> Result<User, UserError> {
📎         guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
❌             return false
✅             return .failure(.invalidInput)
📎         }
📎         
❌         let user = User(name: name, email: email)
✅         let user = User(id: UUID(), name: name, email: email, age: age)
📎         users[email] = user
❌         return true
✅         userCount += 1
✅         return .success(user)
📎     }
📎 }
```

### Terminal Output Features

1. **ANSI Color Support**: Symbols appear in their natural colors in supporting terminals
2. **Instant Recognition**: Visual symbols make scanning diffs effortless
3. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, business-like presentation
4. **Universal Symbols**: Paperclip, X, and checkmark are universally understood

### Generating Terminal Output

### Generating AI-Friendly Output

```swift
// Generate AI-friendly ASCII diff
let aiDiff = MultiLineDiff.createAndDisplayDiff(
    source: oldCode,
    destination: newCode,
    format: .ai
)

// Send to AI model
sendToAI(aiDiff)

// Or using the display method
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(source: oldCode, destination: newCode)
let aiOutput = MultiLineDiff.displayDiff(
    diff: diff,
    source: oldCode,
    format: .ai
)
```

## 🔄 AI Workflow Integration

### AI Submitting Diffs

AI models can submit diffs using the same emoji format:

```swift
let aiSubmittedDiff = """
📎 func calculate() -> Int {
❌     return 42
✅     return 100
📎 }
"""

// Parse and apply AI's diff
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyASCIIDiff(
    to: sourceCode, 
    asciiDiff: aiSubmittedDiff
)
```

### Round-Trip Workflow

1. **Generate diff** → Display as ASCII
2. **Send to AI** → AI processes the diff
3. **AI responds** → With modified ASCII diff
4. **Parse AI diff** → Back to operations
5. **Apply to code** → Get final result

```swift
// Step 1: Generate and display
let originalDiff = MultiLineDiff.createAndDisplayDiff(
    source: source, destination: destination, format: .ai)

// Step 2: Send to AI (AI processes and modifies)
let aiModifiedDiff = sendToAI(originalDiff)

// Step 3: Apply AI's changes
let finalResult = try MultiLineDiff.applyASCIIDiff(
    to: source, asciiDiff: aiModifiedDiff)
```

## 📊 Diff Operation Counts Breakdown

    .retain(1)    // "!"
]

// Diff Counts Breakdown
struct DiffCounts {
    let retain: Int   // Unchanged characters
    let delete: Int   // Removed characters
    let insert: Int   // Added characters
}

let counts = DiffCounts(
    retain: 8,   // "Hello, " and "!"
    delete: 5,   // "world"
    insert: 5    // "Swift"
)

// Visualization
print("Diff Counts:")
print("📎 Retained: \(counts.retain) characters")
print("❌ Deleted:  \(counts.delete) characters")
print("✅ Inserted: \(counts.insert) characters")
```

#### ASCII Diff Output
```
📎 Hello, 
❌ world
✅ Swift
📎 !
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage Patterns

### Batch Processing Multiple Files

```swift
let fileDiffs = files.map { file in
    MultiLineDiff.createAndDisplayDiff(
        source: file.original,
        destination: file.modified,
        format: .ai
    )
}

// Send all diffs to AI for review
let aiReviews = sendBatchToAI(fileDiffs)
```

### Interactive Code Review

```swift
// Generate terminal diff for human review
let humanDiff = MultiLineDiff.createAndDisplayDiff(
    source: oldCode, destination: newCode, format: .terminal)
print("👀 Human Review:")
print(humanDiff)

// Generate AI diff for automated analysis
let aiDiff = MultiLineDiff.createAndDisplayDiff(

```swift
// Test round-trip accuracy
let originalDiff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(source: source, destination: destination)
let asciiDiff = MultiLineDiff.displayDiff(diff: originalDiff, source: source, format: .ai)
let parsedDiff = try MultiLineDiff.parseDiffFromASCII(asciiDiff)
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: source, diff: parsedDiff)

assert(result == destination, "Round-trip failed!")
```

## 🎨 Visual Comparison: Terminal vs AI Output

### Terminal Output (with ANSI colors)
```
📎 class UserManager {    // Blue paperclip
❌     func oldMethod()   // Red X with red background
✅     func newMethod()   // Green checkmark with green background
📎 }                     // Blue paperclip
```

### AI Output (plain ASCII)
```
📎 class UserManager {

# 🔧 Truncated Diffs (Patches): Intelligent Section-Based Diff Application

## 🎯 Overview

**Truncated Diffs** (also known as **Patches**) represent one of the most sophisticated features of the MultiLineDiff library. They enable applying changes to specific sections of large documents without requiring the entire source file, using intelligent metadata-driven section matching.

## 🧠 What Are Truncated Diffs?

Truncated diffs solve a critical problem in code editing: **How do you apply a small change to a large file when you only have a snippet of the original code?**

### 🔍 The Problem

Traditional diff systems require the **complete source** to apply changes:

```swift
// ❌ Traditional approach - needs ENTIRE file
let fullFile = """
import Foundation
import UIKit

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Setup code here
        return true
    }
    
    // 500 more lines...
}

class UserManager {
    private var users: [String: User] = [:]
    
    func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
        guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
            return false
        }
        
        let user = User(name: name, email: email)
        users[email] = user
        return true
    }
}
"""

// Traditional diff needs the ENTIRE file to make a small change
```

### ✅ The Solution: Truncated Diffs

Truncated diffs work with **just the relevant section**:

```swift
// ✅ Truncated diff approach - only needs the section
let codeSection = """
func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
    guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
        return false
    }
    
    let user = User(name: name, email: email)
    users[email] = user
    return true
}
"""

// Can apply changes to just this section within the larger file!
```

## 🏗️ How Truncated Diffs Work

### 📊 Application Types

The system uses two distinct application types:

```swift
@frozen public enum DiffApplicationType: String, Sendable, Codable {
    /// Diff designed for complete documents - apply to full source
    case requiresFullSource
    /// Diff designed for partial/truncated content - needs section matching
    case requiresTruncatedSource
}
```

### 🔄 The Truncated Diff Process

1. **📍 Section Identification**: Find the target section in the full document
2. **🎯 Context Matching**: Use preceding/following context for precise location
3. **⚡ Diff Application**: Apply changes to the identified section
4. **🔧 Document Reconstruction**: Rebuild the complete document with changes

## 🧩 Metadata Magic: The Secret Sauce

### 📋 DiffMetadata Structure

The metadata contains all the intelligence needed for truncated diff application:

```swift
public struct DiffMetadata: Equatable, Codable {
    // 📍 Location Information
    public let sourceStartLine: Int?        // Where the section starts
    public let sourceTotalLines: Int?       // How many lines in the section
    
    // 🎯 Context for Section Matching
    public let precedingContext: String?    // Code before the section
    public let followingContext: String?    // Code after the section
    
    // 🔍 Content for Verification
    public let sourceContent: String?       // Original section content
    public let destinationContent: String?  // Expected result content
    
    // ⚙️ Algorithm and Tracking
    public let algorithmUsed: DiffAlgorithm?
    public let diffHash: String?
    
    // 🎯 Application Type
    public let applicationType: DiffApplicationType?
    
    // ⏱️ Performance Tracking
    public let diffGenerationTime: Double?
}
```

### 🎯 Context Matching Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated confidence-based matching algorithm:

```swift
// 🔍 Find the best matching section in the document
internal static func findBestMatchingSection(
    fullLines: [Substring],
    metadata: DiffMetadata,
    sourceLineCount: Int
) -> Range<Int>? {
    var bestMatchIndex: Int?
    var bestMatchConfidence = 0.0
    
    // 🔄 Search through the document
    for startIndex in 0..<fullLines.count {
        let confidence = calculateSectionMatchConfidence(
            sectionText: sectionText,
            precedingContext: precedingContext,
            followingContext: followingContext,
            fullLines: fullLines,
            sectionStartIndex: startIndex,
            sectionEndIndex: endIndex
        )
        
        // 📈 Update best match if confidence is higher
        if confidence > bestMatchConfidence {
            bestMatchConfidence = confidence
            bestMatchIndex = startIndex
        }
        
        // 🎯 Use high-confidence matches immediately
        if confidence > 0.85 {
            break
        }
    }
    
    // ✅ Require minimum confidence (30%) to proceed
    guard bestMatchConfidence > 0.3 else {
        return nil
    }
    
    return bestMatchIndex..<endIndex
}
```

## 🚀 Creating Truncated Diffs

### 📝 Basic Truncated Diff Creation

```swift
// Create a diff for a specific section with metadata
let sectionDiff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: codeSection,
    destination: modifiedSection,
    algorithm: .optimus,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 45,  // Line number in full file
    destStartLine: 45
)

// The metadata automatically sets applicationType = .requiresTruncatedSource
```

### 🎯 Advanced Truncated Diff with Context

```swift
// Create metadata with context for precise matching
let metadata = DiffMetadata.forSection(
    startLine: 45,
    lineCount: 12,
    context: "class UserManager {\n    private var users: [String: User] = [:]",
    sourceContent: originalSection,
    destinationContent: modifiedSection,
    algorithm: .optimus
)

let truncatedDiff = DiffResult(
    operations: diffOperations,
    metadata: metadata
)
```

## ⚡ Applying Truncated Diffs

### 🔄 Automatic Truncated Source Detection

The system automatically detects when to use truncated source handling:

```swift
// ✅ Automatic detection - no manual configuration needed
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: fullDocument, diff: truncatedDiff)

// The system automatically:
// 1. Detects this is a truncated diff (from metadata)
// 2. Finds the matching section in fullDocument
// 3. Applies changes to just that section
// 4. Reconstructs the complete document
```

### 🎯 Manual Truncated Source Control

```swift
// 🔧 Manual control over truncated source handling
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiffWithEnhancedProcessing(
    source: fullDocument,
    operations: truncatedDiff.operations,
    metadata: truncatedDiff.metadata,
    allowTruncatedSource: true  // Explicitly enable
)
```

## 📝 ASCII Diff Format for Truncated Diffs

### 🎨 Truncated ASCII Diff Example

**Original Section:**
```swift
func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
    guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
        return false
    }
    
    let user = User(name: name, email: email)
    users[email] = user
    return true
}
```

**Modified Section:**
```swift
func addUser(name: String, email: String, age: Int = 0) -> Result<User, UserError> {
    guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
        return .failure(.invalidInput)
    }
    
    let user = User(id: UUID(), name: name, email: email, age: age)
    users[email] = user
    userCount += 1
    return .success(user)
}
```

**Truncated ASCII Diff:**
```swift
❌ func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
✅ func addUser(name: String, email: String, age: Int = 0) -> Result<User, UserError> {
📎     guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
❌         return false
✅         return .failure(.invalidInput)
📎     }
📎     
❌     let user = User(name: name, email: email)
✅     let user = User(id: UUID(), name: name, email: email, age: age)
📎     users[email] = user
❌     return true
✅     userCount += 1
✅     return .success(user)
📎 }
```

### 🔄 Parsing Truncated ASCII Diffs

let truncatedDiff = try MultiLineDiff.parseDiffFromASCII(asciiDiff)

// The parser automatically sets:
// - applicationType = .requiresFullSource (default)
// - Can be overridden with metadata

// Apply to full document
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyASCIIDiff(
    to: fullDocument,
    asciiDiff: asciiDiff
)
```

## 🎯 Real-World Truncated Diff Examples

### 📝 Example 1: Function Enhancement in Large File

**Scenario**: Enhance a function in a 1000-line Swift file

```swift
// 📄 Full document (1000 lines)
let fullSwiftFile = """
import Foundation
import UIKit

// ... 900 lines of code ...

class UserManager {
    private var users: [String: User] = [:]
    
    func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
        guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
            return false
        }
        
        let user = User(name: name, email: email)
        users[email] = user
        return true
    }
    
    // ... more methods ...
}

// ... 100 more lines ...
"""

// 🎯 Create truncated diff for just the function
let functionSection = """
func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Bool {
    guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
        return false
    }
    
    let user = User(name: name, email: email)
    users[email] = user
    return true
}
"""

let enhancedFunction = """
func addUser(name: String, email: String, age: Int = 0) -> Result<User, UserError> {
    guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {
        return .failure(.invalidInput)
    }
    
    guard !users.keys.contains(email) else {
        return .failure(.userAlreadyExists)
    }
    
    let user = User(id: UUID(), name: name, email: email, age: age)
    users[email] = user
    userCount += 1
    return .success(user)
}
"""

// ✅ Create truncated diff with context
let truncatedDiff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: functionSection,
    destination: enhancedFunction,
    algorithm: .optimus,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 905  // Line number in full file
)

// 🚀 Apply to full document - automatically finds and updates the function
let updatedFile = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: fullSwiftFile, diff: truncatedDiff)
```

### 🔧 Example 2: Configuration Update with Context

**Scenario**: Update a configuration section with surrounding context

```swift
// 📋 Create metadata with context for precise matching
let configMetadata = DiffMetadata(
    sourceStartLine: 25,
    sourceTotalLines: 8,
    precedingContext: "# Database Configuration\n# Production settings",
    followingContext: "# Logging Configuration\nlog_level=info",
    sourceContent: originalConfigSection,
    destinationContent: updatedConfigSection,
    algorithmUsed: .flash,
    applicationType: .requiresTruncatedSource
)

let configDiff = DiffResult(
    operations: configOperations,
    metadata: configMetadata
)

// 🎯 Apply with high confidence matching
let updatedConfig = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: fullConfigFile, diff: configDiff)
```

## 🔍 Metadata-Driven Intelligence

### 🧠 Automatic Application Type Detection

```swift
// 🤖 The system automatically detects application type
public static func autoDetectApplicationType(
    sourceStartLine: Int?,
    precedingContext: String?,
    followingContext: String?,
    sourceContent: String?
) -> DiffApplicationType {
    
    // 🎯 Non-zero start line = truncated
    if let startLine = sourceStartLine, startLine > 0 {
        return .requiresTruncatedSource
    }
    
    // 📍 Has context = truncated
    if precedingContext != nil || followingContext != nil {
        return .requiresTruncatedSource
    }
    
    // 🔍 Has stored content = can verify truncated
    if sourceContent != nil {
        return .requiresTruncatedSource
    }
    
    // 📄 Default to full source
    return .requiresFullSource
}
```

### 🎯 Smart Source Verification

```swift
// 🔍 Intelligent source matching
public static func requiresTruncatedHandling(
    providedSource: String,
    storedSource: String?
) -> Bool {
    guard let stored = storedSource else { return false }
    
    // 📄 Provided source contains stored = applying to full document
    if providedSource.contains(stored) && providedSource != stored {
        return true  // ✅ Use truncated handling
    }
    
    // 🎯 Exact match = no truncated handling needed
    if stored == providedSource {
        return false  // ❌ Use normal handling
    }
    
    // 🔧 Different content = likely needs truncated handling
    if stored != providedSource {
        return true  // ✅ Use truncated handling
    }
    
    return false
}
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Truncated Diff Patterns

### 🔄 Section Diff Workflow

```swift
// 1️⃣ Extract section from large document
let section = extractSection(from: largeDocument, startLine: 100, lineCount: 20)

// 2️⃣ Create diff for the section
let sectionDiff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: section,
    destination: modifiedSection,
    algorithm: .optimus,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 100
)

// 3️⃣ Apply back to full document
let updatedDocument = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: largeDocument, diff: sectionDiff)
```

### 🎯 Multi-Section Updates

```swift
// 📝 Apply multiple truncated diffs to the same document
var document = originalDocument

for sectionDiff in truncatedDiffs {
    document = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: document, diff: sectionDiff)
}

// Each diff automatically finds its target section
```

### 🔍 Confidence-Based Matching

```swift
// 🎯 Custom confidence thresholds
func applyWithCustomConfidence(
    diff: DiffResult,
    to document: String,
    minimumConfidence: Double = 0.5
) throws -> String {
    
    // Modify the confidence threshold in metadata
    var modifiedMetadata = diff.metadata
    // Apply with custom confidence logic
    
    return try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: document, diff: diff)
}
```

# MultiLineDiff JSON I/O Documentation

## Overview

The MultiLineDiff library provides comprehensive JSON serialization and Base64 encoding capabilities for safe storage and internet transport of diff operations. This document covers all JSON formats, encoding options, and transport mechanisms.

## 🔧 Core JSON Features

### Safe Base64 Encoding
- **Compact representation** for efficient storage
- **Internet-safe transport** with standard Base64 encoding
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across different systems
- **Metadata preservation** with optional context information
- **Integrity verification** through SHA256 hashing

### Encoding Formats
- **JSON Data** (`Data`) - Raw binary JSON for high-performance applications
- **JSON String** (`String`) - Human-readable JSON for debugging and APIs
- **Base64 String** (`String`) - Compact encoded format for transport and storage

## 📊 JSON Structure Overview

### Wrapper Format
All MultiLineDiff JSON uses a consistent wrapper structure:

```json
{
  "df": "base64-encoded-operations",
  "md": "base64-encoded-metadata"
}
```

**For Base64 encoding:**
```json
{
  "op": "base64-encoded-operations", 
  "mt": "base64-encoded-metadata"
}
```

## 🔄 DiffOperation JSON Format

### Operation Types
The `DiffOperation` enum uses compact single-character keys for maximum efficiency:

```swift
public enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
    case retain = "="    // Keep characters from source
    case insert = "+"    // Add new content
    case delete = "-"    // Remove characters from source
}
```

### JSON Examples

**Retain Operation:**
```json
{
  "=": 15
}
```
*Keeps 15 characters from the source text*

**Insert Operation:**
```json
{
  "+": "Hello, World!"
}
```
*Inserts the string "Hello, World!" into the destination*

**Delete Operation:**
```json
{
  "-": 8
}
```
*Removes 8 characters from the source text*

### Complete Operations Array
```json
[
  { "=": 5 },
  { "-": 3 },
  { "+": "Swift" },
  { "=": 10 }
]
```
*This sequence: keeps 5 chars, deletes 3 chars, inserts "Swift", keeps 10 chars*

## 📋 DiffMetadata JSON Format

### Compact Keys
Metadata uses 3-character keys for maximum JSON size reduction:

```swift
public enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
    case sourceStartLine = "str"      // Start line number
    case sourceTotalLines = "cnt"     // Total line count  
    case precedingContext = "pre"     // Context before section
    case followingContext = "fol"     // Context after section
    case sourceContent = "src"        // Original source content
    case destinationContent = "dst"   // Target destination content
    case algorithmUsed = "alg"        // Algorithm used
    case diffHash = "hsh"             // SHA256 integrity hash
    case applicationType = "app"      // Application type
    case diffGenerationTime = "tim"   // Performance timing
}
```

### Example Metadata JSON
```json
{
  "str": 42,
  "cnt": 15,
  "pre": "class UserManager {\n    private var users: [String: User] = [:]",
  "fol": "    \n    func validateUser(_ user: User) -> Bool {",
  "src": "func addUser(name: String) -> Bool {\n    return users[name] != nil\n}",
  "dst": "func addUser(name: String, email: String) -> Result<User, UserError> {\n    guard !name.isEmpty && !email.isEmpty else {\n        return .failure(.invalidInput)\n    }\n    return .success(User(name: name, email: email))\n}",
  "alg": "megatron",
  "hsh": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "app": "requiresTruncatedSource",
  "tim": 0.0234
}
```

### Algorithm Values
```json
{
  "alg": "zoom"        // Simple, fast O(n) algorithm
}
{
  "alg": "megatron"    // Semantic O(n log n) algorithm  
}
{
  "alg": "flash"       // Swift native prefix/suffix (fastest)
}
{
  "alg": "starscream"  // Swift native line-aware
}
{
  "alg": "optimus"     // Swift native with CollectionDifference
}
{
  "alg": "aigenerated" // AI-submitted diff with enhanced metadata
}
```

### Application Type Values
```json
{
  "app": "requiresFullSource"      // Apply to complete source document
}
{
  "app": "requiresTruncatedSource" // Apply to document section with context matching
}
```

    to: sourceCode,
    encodedDiff: jsonString,
    encoding: .jsonString
)
```

## 📦 Complete JSON Examples

### Simple Diff (Operations Only)
```json
{
  "df": "W3siPSI6NX0seyItIjozfSx7IisiOiJTd2lmdCJ9LHsiPSI6MTB9XQ=="
}
```

*Base64 decodes to:*
```json
[
  {"=": 5},
  {"-": 3}, 
  {"+": "Swift"},
  {"=": 10}
]
```

### Complete Diff with Metadata
```json
{
  "df": "W3siPSI6NX0seyItIjozfSx7IisiOiJTd2lmdCJ9LHsiPSI6MTB9XQ==",
  "md": "eyJzdHIiOjQyLCJjbnQiOjE1LCJhbGciOiJtZWdhdHJvbiIsImFwcCI6InJlcXVpcmVzRnVsbFNvdXJjZSJ9"
}
```

*Metadata Base64 decodes to:*
```json
{
  "str": 42,
  "cnt": 15,
  "alg": "megatron",
  "app": "requiresFullSource"
}
```

### Base64 Format (Compact Transport)
```json
{
  "op": "W3siPSI6NX0seyItIjozfSx7IisiOiJTd2lmdCJ9LHsiPSI6MTB9XQ==",
  "mt": "eyJzdHIiOjQyLCJjbnQiOjE1LCJhbGciOiJtZWdhdHJvbiJ9"
}
```

## 🔐 Security and Transport

### Base64 Encoding Benefits
- **URL-safe** characters only (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, =)
- **Database-safe** storage without escaping issues
- **JSON-safe** as string values without special character conflicts
- **Email-safe** transmission through SMTP systems
- **HTTP-safe** in headers, query parameters, and POST bodies

### Integrity Verification
```swift
// Metadata includes SHA256 hash for verification
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: source,
    destination: destination,
    includeMetadata: true
)

// Hash is automatically generated and stored in metadata
if let hash = diff.metadata?.diffHash {
    print("Diff integrity hash: \(hash)")
}
```

### Size Optimization
- **Compact keys**: 3-character metadata keys reduce JSON size by ~40%
- **Base64 encoding**: Operations and metadata are separately encoded
- **Optional metadata**: Include only when needed for context
- **Efficient algorithms**: Flash algorithm produces minimal operations

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Storage Recommendations
```swift
// For databases - use Base64 strings
let base64Diff = try MultiLineDiff.diffToBase64(diff)
database.store(key: "diff_123", value: base64Diff)

// For APIs - use JSON strings with metadata
let jsonDiff = try MultiLineDiff.encodeDiffToJSONString(diff, prettyPrinted: false)
api.send(payload: jsonDiff)

// For files - use pretty-printed JSON
let prettyJson = try MultiLineDiff.encodeDiffToJSONString(diff, prettyPrinted: true)
try prettyJson.write(to: fileURL, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
```

### Performance Optimization
```swift
// For maximum speed - use Flash algorithm with minimal metadata
let fastDiff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: source,
    destination: destination,
    algorithm: .flash,
    includeMetadata: false
)

// For maximum detail - use Megatron with full metadata
let detailedDiff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: source,
    destination: destination, 
    algorithm: .megatron,
    includeMetadata: true
)
```

### Error Handling
```swift
do {
    let diff = try MultiLineDiff.diffFromBase64(base64String)
    let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: source, diff: diff)
    print("✅ Diff applied successfully")
} catch DiffError.decodingFailed {
    print("❌ Invalid Base64 or JSON format")
} catch DiffError.encodingFailed {
    print("❌ Failed to encode diff")
} catch {
    print("❌ Unexpected error: \(error)")
}
```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Encoding Performance
- **JSON Data**: Fastest encoding (~0.1ms for typical diffs)
- **JSON String**: Fast encoding with UTF-8 conversion (~0.2ms)
- **Base64 String**: Compact with additional Base64 step (~0.3ms)

### Size Comparison
| Format | Typical Size | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| JSON Data | 100% baseline | In-memory processing |
| JSON String | 100% + UTF-8 overhead | API responses, debugging |
| Base64 String | 75% of JSON | Database storage, transport |

### Memory Usage
- **Streaming encoding**: Minimal memory overhead
- **Lazy decoding**: Operations decoded on-demand
- **Metadata caching**: Context preserved for reuse

## 🔄 Legacy Compatibility

### Format Migration
```swift
// The library automatically handles legacy formats
let modernDiff = try MultiLineDiff.diffFromBase64(legacyBase64String)

// Convert legacy format to modern format
let modernBase64 = try MultiLineDiff.diffToBase64(modernDiff)
```

### Algorithm Mapping
```swift
// Legacy algorithm names are automatically mapped
let algorithm = DiffAlgorithm.from(legacy: "brus") // Returns .zoom
let algorithm2 = DiffAlgorithm.from(legacy: "todd") // Returns .megatron
```

This comprehensive JSON I/O system ensures MultiLineDiff operations can be safely stored, transmitted, and processed across any platform or system that supports JSON and Base64 encoding.
