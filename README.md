- **Auto-detection of full vs truncated sources** 🆕
- **Intelligent context-based matching** 🆕

#### Truncated Diff Usage: Line Number Handling

When working with truncated sources, follow these guidelines for `sourceStartLine`:

1. **If You Know the Exact Line Number**:
```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Enhanced core methods (automatically handles everything)
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedContent,
    destination: modifiedContent,
    sourceStartLine: 42  // Optional: enhances accuracy
)

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual configuration
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedContent,
    destination: modifiedContent,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 42  // Manual parameter required
)
```

2. **If Line Number is Unknown**:
```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Core methods (auto-interpolates)
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedContent,
    destination: modifiedContent
    // No sourceStartLine needed - core methods handle it
)

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual fallback
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedContent,
    destination: modifiedContent,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 1  // Manual fallback
)
```

**Enhanced Core Practices**:
- **Best Practice**: Use `createDiff()` - automatically handles line interpolation
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Optionally specify `sourceStartLine` for better precision
- Core methods use dual context and confidence scoring for intelligent section location
- Built-in verification ensures correct application

### Line Number Interpolation

The core methods automatically:
- Analyzes preceding and following context
- Uses metadata to determine the most likely section
- Intelligently applies the diff to the correct location
- Provides confidence scoring for section matching

"""

// ✅ PREFERRED: Enhanced core methods (fully automatic)
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: updatedSection
)

// Apply intelligently - works on both full document and truncated section
let updatedDocument = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: originalDocument, diff: diff)

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual configuration required
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: updatedSection,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 2
)

let updatedDocument = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(
    to: originalDocument, 
    diff: diff,
    allowTruncatedSource: true  // Manual parameter
)
```

The core methods handle all the complexity automatically while providing the same powerful functionality.

```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Core methods - fully automatic
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: updatedSection
)

// Intelligent application - automatically detects if full document or truncated source
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: anySource, diff: diff)
// Works with BOTH full documents AND truncated sections automatically!

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual detection required
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: updatedSection,
    includeMetadata: true,
    sourceStartLine: 2  // Manual parameter
)

// Manual application with parameters
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: anySource, diff: diff)
// Requires manual `allowTruncatedSource` configuration
```

### 🔐 Enhanced Verification and Undo Operations

```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Core methods with built-in verification
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: originalCode,
    destination: modifiedCode
)

// Automatic verification and checksum generation
if let hash = diff.metadata?.diffHash {
    print("✅ Diff integrity hash: \(hash)")
}

// Apply with automatic verification
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: originalCode, diff: diff)

// Undo operation (automatic reverse diff)
let undoDiff = MultiLineDiff.createUndoDiff(from: diff)!
let restored = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: result, diff: undoDiff)
assert(restored == originalCode) // Perfect restoration

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual verification steps
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: originalCode,
    destination: modifiedCode,
    includeMetadata: true
)

// Manual checksum verification
if let hash = diff.metadata?.diffHash {
    print("Diff integrity hash: \(hash)")
}

// Manual application
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: originalCode, diff: diff)

// Manual undo diff creation
let undoDiff = MultiLineDiff.createUndoDiff(from: diff)
let restored = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: result, diff: undoDiff!)
assert(restored == originalCode)
```

### 🎯 Dual Context Matching Example

```swift
let fullDocument = """
# Documentation
## Setup Instructions
Setup content here.
## Configuration Settings  
Please follow these setup steps carefully.
This configuration is essential for operation.
## Advanced Configuration
Advanced content here.
"""

let truncatedSection = """

This configuration is CRITICAL for operation.
"""

// ✅ PREFERRED: Core methods with enhanced dual context
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: modifiedSection
)

// Automatic intelligent application - works on BOTH:
let resultFromFull = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: fullDocument, diff: diff)
let resultFromTruncated = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: truncatedSection, diff: diff)

// Both results are correctly transformed with automatic context matching!

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual dual context handling
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: truncatedSection,
    destination: modifiedSection,
    includeMetadata: true
)

// Manual application with explicit parameters
let resultFromFull = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: fullDocument, diff: diff, allowTruncatedSource: true)
let resultFromTruncated = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: truncatedSection, diff: diff)
```

## 🛡️ Reliability & Automatic Verification

MultiLineDiff includes a built-in verification system that ensures diff reliability through automatic algorithm fallback.

### Automatic Algorithm Fallback

When using the Todd algorithm (`.todd`), the library now includes a sophisticated verification mechanism:

1. **Create Diff**: Generate diff using Todd algorithm
2. **Verify Integrity**: Apply the diff to source and verify result matches destination
3. **Automatic Fallback**: If verification fails, automatically fallback to Brus algorithm
4. **Transparent Operation**: Users get reliable results without manual intervention

### How Verification Works

```swift
// When you request Todd algorithm
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: sourceCode,
    destination: destinationCode,
    algorithm: .todd  // Todd algorithm with automatic fallback
)

// Internal process:
// 1. Generate Todd diff
// 2. Apply Todd diff to source
// 3. Check: result == destination?
//    ✅ Yes → Return Todd diff (more granular)
//    ❌ No  → Automatically use Brus diff (more reliable)
```

### Verification Benefits

- **Zero False Positives**: Diffs are guaranteed to work correctly
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Get Todd's sophistication when possible, Brus's reliability when needed
- **Transparent Fallback**: No additional code required from developers
- **Metadata Tracking**: `algorithmUsed` metadata reflects actual algorithm used

### Fallback Scenarios

The system automatically falls back to Brus algorithm when:
- Todd diff produces incorrect transformation results
- Todd diff operations cannot be applied to source
- Complex text structures that challenge Todd's semantic analysis

### Example with Fallback Tracking

```swift
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: complexSource,
    destination: complexDestination,
    algorithm: .todd,
    includeMetadata: true
)

// Check which algorithm was actually used
if let actualAlgorithm = diff.metadata?.algorithmUsed {
    switch actualAlgorithm {
    case .todd:
        print("✅ Todd algorithm succeeded - granular diff")
    case .brus:
        print("🔄 Fallback to Brus algorithm - reliable diff")
    }
}

// Either way, the diff is guaranteed to work correctly
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: complexSource, diff: diff)
assert(result == complexDestination) // Always passes
```

### Verification Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: Verification adds ~0.1ms for typical diffs
- **Early Exit**: If Todd succeeds (most cases), no additional processing
- **Smart Caching**: Verification results are internally optimized

## 🚀 Why Base64?

1. **Compact Representation**: Reduces diff size
2. **Safe Transmission**: Avoids escaping issues
3. **Universal Compatibility**: Works across different systems
4. **AI-Friendly**: Ideal for code transformation pipelines

## 📦 Usage Examples

### Basic Single-Line Diff

```swift
let source = "Hello, world!"
let destination = "Hello, Swift!"

// ✅ PREFERRED: Enhanced core methods approach
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(source: source, destination: destination)
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: source, diff: diff)
print(result == destination) // true

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual approach  
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(source: source, destination: destination)
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: source, diff: diff)
print(result == destination) // true
```

### Choosing Diff Algorithms

```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Enhanced core methods with automatic algorithm selection
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: sourceCode, 
    destination: destinationCode
    // Algorithm automatically selected with fallback verification
)

// Automatic recommendation (for reference)
let recommendedAlgorithm = MultiLineDiff.suggestDiffAlgorithm(
    source: sourceCode, 
    destination: destinationCode
)

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual algorithm selection
// Todd algorithm with automatic fallback (recommended)
let reliableDiff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: sourceCode, 
    destination: destinationCode, 
    algorithm: .todd  // Automatically falls back to Brus if needed
)

// Explicitly select Brus algorithm (always reliable)
let brusDiff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: sourceCode, 
    destination: destinationCode, 
    algorithm: .brus
)
```

### Algorithm Selection Guide

| Scenario | Enhanced Core Approach | Traditional Approach | Fallback Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **AI Code Transformations** | `createDiff()` | `.todd` | ✅ Automatic fallback to `.brus` |
| **Production Systems** | `createDiff()` | `.todd` | ✅ Automatic fallback to `.brus` |
| **Performance Critical** | `createDiff()` | `.brus` | ❌ No fallback needed |
| **Simple Text Changes** | `createDiff()` | `.brus` | ❌ No fallback needed |

**Best Practice**: Use `createDiff()` for all scenarios - you get sophisticated diffs when possible, with automatic reliability guarantees through fallback, plus intelligent application handling.

### Base64 Encoded Diffs (Recommended for AI Transformations)

```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Enhanced core methods with Base64
let base64Diff = try MultiLineDiff.createBase64Diff(
    source: sourceCode, 
    destination: destinationCode
)

// Apply with automatic intelligence
let reconstructedCode = try MultiLineDiff.applyBase64Diff(
    to: sourceCode, 
    base64Diff: base64Diff
)

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual Base64 handling
let base64Diff = try MultiLineDiff.createBase64Diff(
    source: sourceCode, 
    destination: destinationCode
)

// Manual application
let reconstructedCode = try MultiLineDiff.applyBase64Diff(
    to: sourceCode, 
    base64Diff: base64Diff,
    allowTruncatedSource: false  // Manual parameter
)
```

### File-Based Diff Operations

```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Enhanced core methods with file operations
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: sourceCode,
    destination: destinationCode
)

// Save diff to file
try MultiLineDiff.saveDiffToFile(
    diff, 
    fileURL: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/diff.json")
)

// Load and apply diff from file
let loadedDiff = try MultiLineDiff.loadDiffFromFile(
    fileURL: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/diff.json")
)
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: targetSource, diff: loadedDiff)

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual file operations
// Save diff to a file
try MultiLineDiff.saveDiffToFile(
    multiLineDiff, 
    fileURL: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/diff.json")
)

// Load diff from a file
let loadedDiff = try MultiLineDiff.loadDiffFromFile(
    fileURL: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/diff.json")
)
```

### 🆕 NEW Auto-Detection & Verification Features (2025)

```swift
// ✅ PREFERRED: Enhanced core methods handle everything automatically
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: anySource,  // Can be full document OR truncated section
    destination: modifiedContent
    // Auto-detection built-in, no manual configuration needed
)

// Apply intelligently - automatic configuration
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: anyTarget, diff: diff)

// Verification and undo operations (automatic)
if MultiLineDiff.verifyDiff(diff) {
    print("✅ Diff integrity verified automatically")
}

if let undoDiff = MultiLineDiff.createUndoDiff(from: diff) {
    let restored = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: result, diff: undoDiff)
}

// Enhanced metadata access (automatic)
if let metadata = diff.metadata {
    print("Algorithm used: \(metadata.algorithmUsed)")
    print("Application type: \(metadata.applicationType)")
    print("Source lines: \(metadata.sourceTotalLines)")
    print("Integrity hash: \(metadata.diffHash ?? "none")")
}

// ❌ TRADITIONAL: Manual configuration and verification
// 1. Manual detection required
let diff = MultiLineDiff.createDiff(
    source: anySource,  // Can be full document OR truncated section
    destination: modifiedContent,
    includeMetadata: true  // Manual parameter required
)

// Apply with manual configuration - no automatic detection
let result = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: anyTarget, diff: diff)

// 2. Manual checksum verification
if let hash = diff.metadata?.diffHash {
    print("✅ Diff integrity verified: \(String(hash.prefix(16)))...")
}

// 3. Manual undo operations
let undoDiff = MultiLineDiff.createUndoDiff(from: diff)
let restored = try MultiLineDiff.applyDiff(to: result, diff: undoDiff!)

// 4. Manual source verification (requires custom logic)
// The library automatically compares input source with stored source content
// and determines the best application strategy

// 5. Manual metadata access
if let metadata = diff.metadata {
    print("Algorithm used: \(metadata.algorithmUsed)")
    print("Application type: \(metadata.applicationType)")
    print("Source lines: \(metadata.sourceLines)")
    print("Preceding context: \(metadata.precedingContext)")
    print("Following context: \(metadata.followingContext)")
}
```

```

### Retain Operation Example

```swift
Source:      "Hello, world!"
Destination: "Hello, Swift!"
Operation:    ====== ▼        // Retain "Hello, "
             ||||||  |
             Hello,  w
```

### Delete Operation Example

```swift
Source:      "Hello, world!"
Destination: "Hello!"
Operation:    ====== -----    // Delete "world"
             |||||| xxxxx
             Hello, world
```

### Insert Operation Example

```swift
Source:      "Hello!"
Destination: "Hello, world!"
Operation:    ====== ++++++   // Insert ", world"
             |||||| ------
